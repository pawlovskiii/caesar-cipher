### General info 
My implementation of famous Caesar cipher. It's a popular technique of data encryption. It's all about shifting letters in the alphabet (in this case, with optional n-letter shift).

### Technologies
Implementation created with Parcel (as bundling tool), Jest (as testing framework), babel-jest (to enable the use of ES6 Modules with Jest framework) and ESLint (for improving syntax and enforce code style). During this project I also wanted to deploy it specifically on the Github Pages, to keep everything in one place and get to know this environment.
