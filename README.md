### General info 
My implementation of caesar cipher (ROT13). It's popular technique of data encryption. It's all about shifting letters in the alphabet (in this case, it's ROT13 - 13 letters shift).

### Technologies
Implementation created with Parcel (as bundling tool), Jest (as testing framework), babel-jest (to enable the use of ES6 Modules with Jest framework) and ESLint (for improving syntax and enforce code style). During this project I also wanted to deploy it into the web, by using Github Pages.
